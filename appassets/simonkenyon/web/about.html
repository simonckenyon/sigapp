					<p>This Android app was developed with a number of objectives:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To present my CV</li>
						<li>Demonstrate that I do know something about developing
							apps</li>
						<li>To explore a new class of mobile app</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This app is a pretty straightforward translation of my
						current CV into an app. The rationale/explanation for this is that
						I was driving home from work and I was listening to the radio
						(George Hook on Newstalk as it happens). He was discussing resumes
						and how some people had resorted to the use of video to present
						themselves to prospective employer.</p>
					<p>This was in the context of people applying to Newstalk
						itself. George was quite taken aback that somebody would use
						youtube as a means for applying.</p>
					<p>Given that my expertise is in the design and development of
						software, I thought about how I could apply the use of technology
						to the process of obtaining a new role. Apart from the use of
						Microsoft Word and Excel and email, my only foray into this
						territory was the re-casting on my CV into a portable wiki.</p>
					<p>So I decided to create this app. Hopefully it demonstrates
						that I can in fact develop android apps.</p>
					<p>This brings me to the last of my three considerations listed
						above. Rather than create a single-instance app, all of which it
						did was partition my CV into a number of separate panes, I decided
						to create a general solution to the problem of presenting
						information to a user in a mbile form. The app consists of four
						parts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The app itself</li>
						<li>An XML file which describes the contents</li>
						<li>The contents</li>
						<li>A mechanism for including the XML and contents into the
							app at build time</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This is reflected in the name of the app, Single-Instance
						Generator App (sigapp)</p>
					<p>This is an area which I will continue to explore. My plan is
						to create a web site where a user can enter the content, be it
						text (wiki), images and video. This would be bundled up and
						injected into the app, which then can be downloaded by the user.
						Examples of where this might be useful include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rules and regulations</li>
						<li>Processed and procedures</li>
						<li>Product documentation</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The list is endless. Follow by blog on <a
							href="http://simonkenyon.com">simonkenyon.com</a> and see how I
						get on.
